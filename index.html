		<span id="maya"> Hello! I'm Maya and this is my website. I'm just experimenting with html right now :). 
			<br/> I'm a student studying computer science and philosophy at CU Boulder.
			<br/> I grew up in Thailand and Japan but I moved to Colorado for high school! 
			<br/> I hope you like my website.
			<a href ="https://sweetcottoncandy1234.github.io/websiteDSProject/"> Here's a link to my data structures project! <a>
			<br/> <a href ="https://www.hercampus.com/author/maya-douglas"> I write for an online magazine called Her Campus at my school. I'm new to writing articles but hey, there's nothing wrong with trying out new things. <a>
			<br/> <br/> <br/> I'm starting a garden right now and here's my progress.

			<br/> These are my seeds! I'm not sponsored by Botanic Interests, I swear. It's my favorite brand though. I already planted everything except for the beans, which is soaking as I type this. Some of the radish and squash seeds are already germinating. This is good news because I'm obviously not supposed to start a garden in May LOL. Let's see how this goes.
