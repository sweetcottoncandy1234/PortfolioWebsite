	Some of my projects.
<br/>
<br/>
    Check out the code I wrote for my Software Development Method and Tools class. As my final project, I wrote a website that lets users upload recipes, as well as reviews for any recipes that are part of the website's database. I used HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and SQL to build it.

    Here's a wireframe that I built on Figma! It's for a social media app that lets students connect with others in their class.

    My final project for data structures, which I took freshman year, looked at the how long different structures took to run data.
