    I am part of Phi Sigma Rho, a sorority of women in engineering and other STEM fields. I was Director of Philanthropy for a bit. My sorority sisters and I helped out the greater Boulder community by making food for the homeless, and gardening for non-profit organizations.

    I've been writing for a school magazine called Her Campus since freshman year. I've written 35 articles so far. Some topics I've written about include tech, social justice issues, and pop culture news. I've also written some comedic articles.

    I'm a dedicated member of CU Boulder's Philosophy Club. We meet up to talk about readings and philosophers that we're passionate about. Philosophy is more than a hobby to me - it shapes my worldview, which gives me more perspective of what my goals are as a programmer.
